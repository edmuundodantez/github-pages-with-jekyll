This is my first post in this blog. I'm not sure about what should I write and I might delete it later. 
Just for the sake of writing anything, I'll try to describe what I've learnt so far from the translation world.
1. Be concise;
2. Read the text before translating;
3. Use a CAT tool;
4. Be curious and suspicious of easy translations;
5. Understand your limits;
6. And work hard!
